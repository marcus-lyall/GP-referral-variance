# GP-referral-variance
Analysis of referral rates to acute medicine from General Practice:
This is an R code for reference to allow other researchers to perform analysis on unscheduled medical care data. 
It is appreciated that data sources and types will differ in other healthcare systems and data infrastructures. 
Compete code used in all data wrangling and importing is not included here for all data sources as this will be confusing and relates
to patient pathways in our region that will not be transferable in other areas. Therefore clear
examples of how all variables are added, filtered, factorised, grouped, plotted and statistically analyised are availiable and can be adapted for bespoke use.
